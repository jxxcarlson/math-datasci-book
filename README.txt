This repository contains code for the math + datascience book I am writing. 
Both the code and the book are works-in-progress.  More details to follow.

- spectrogram.py:  Code to display a spectrogram of an audio file and play the audio.

- point-cloud-1.py:  Code to generate a synthetic 2-D point cloud with noise and clusters
  then to find and display the clusters.  Uses DBSCAN.

- point-cloud-2.py:  Like point-cloud-1.py, but the synthetic data is 5-D. It is 
  projected into the plane using PCA.
